Automating strategiies

1. Pick the right thing to automate
ex.
- syslog
- host keys
- Accounts
- configs

2. Don't earn 2 thing at once
- Automate what you know
- Don't automate your automation framework as your first project
- 3 pass automation (figure it out, refine the setup, declare state)

3. Puppet Tooling to you better
- Inventory service (facter, custom facts, facts.d, ...)
- Live Management (PE)
- RAL (puppet resource)
- puppet describe 
- noop
- geppetto
- vim
- Resources (forge, ask, )
- IRC
4. Start Simple/Stay Simple
- build small, single-purpose, module
- Time Measurements
- WHAT TO KNOW FROM NEW SYSTEM THAT COME ONLINE:
  * Pupblic IP in hosts
  * Puppetmaster in Hosts
  * My user account
  * My ssh key
  * Install vim-enhenced
  * setup backup
  * Add me to sudoers
  * Setup locate
  * Bind utils
  * Define test approver
  * define Business approver
  * Classify as Prod/Dev
  * Install wget
  * Configure monitoring
  * Add EPEL
  * Configure Vim
  * Configure SELinux
  * Install man, strace
- Deliver units of values

5. Iteration
- VCS
- Have a Lab
- Improve your work flow
- Refactor
